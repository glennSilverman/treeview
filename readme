TreeView - Demonstration of Lift's TreeView widget

The program allows the user to add roles to the database. Roles can have a parent role.
The TreeView widget displays the role hierarchy you create. Clicking on a tree item 
displays the role in a properties view which can be edited.

There is a bug, however, in that saving changes to the role in the properties view does
not work at this time.
